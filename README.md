# Neural_Engineering
This repository contains the code, data files, and reports for each of the neural engineering projects for BME6360. See the corresponding reports (.pdf files) for in-depth explanations. The projects are as follows:

Project 1 – Spike Sorting:

This project involved creating a program to sort rodent neuron spikes using two methods: principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering.

Project 2 – Neural Encoding:

This project involved creating a program to analyze the extent to which the given motor neurons were tuned to a particular direction of motion. This was done by making raster plots, peri-event time histograms, and tuning curves. 

Project 3 – P300 Wave:

This project involved creating a program to recognize the presence of the P300 wave in the “oddball” response when the subject saw the desired character vs the “standard” response when the subject didn’t. This was done using evoked potential plots, correlation plots, and correlation topographies.
